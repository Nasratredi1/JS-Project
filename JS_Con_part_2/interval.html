<!-- But here's the interesting part, when the DOM content is loaded we run this function called set interval, 
count, and 1,000. So what this is basically saying is every 1,000 milliseconds, or every second, 
run the count function again. And the result of that is-- I can open up interval.HTML. And then without 
doing anything, every one second we're just going to increment that counter again and again and again.  -->
