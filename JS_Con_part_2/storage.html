            BRIAN YU: Sure. What is the scope of local storage? How wide does it go? When you deploy applications to the internet it's by the domain name. So something .COM,
             for instance, would have its own local storage. In the case of files, your file systems basically are all going to share the same local storage. And you can actually 
             see the contents of what's inside of local storage if you want to. If I Control Click on Chrome, at least, go into the inspector.
