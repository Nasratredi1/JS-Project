<!-- Every React component has a number of what are called lifecycle methods,
 or functions that are going to run at a particular point in the component's life.
  And one of the most common is a special function in React called componentDidMount. 
  There are a number of others. The only one we're going to talk about today is componentDidMount
   And componentDidMount is a special method in React that is going to run as soon as a component is mounted 
   into the dom. In other words, as soon as we add this component into the dom, this is the method that's going to run 
   before it actually ultimately renders the contents of what's going to show up.
