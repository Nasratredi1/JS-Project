                button.onclick = function() {
                    document.querySelector('#hello').style.color = button.dataset.color;

        /* Explanition  of HTML 
        I have heading, hello and then I have buttons, but these buttons have a few other different attributes
        These button, insteed of having an ID, have a class because I want this class to refer to all three buttons
        The class is called color change so later i can sya, all right.

        and they also have this data attribute. And this data attributes is something that you can add 
        to HTML elements if you want to store data alongside those elements.
        And in perticular, I want each of my buttons to store data about what color
        they should change the heading to when I click on that button.

        so here i'm saying, button class equals color change.
        data color equalls red, in order to mean. I want to store along with this button
        some information and the information about what color it should turn.
        it should turn the heading red in this case. and more.

        JS Explanition

        wait for the whole page to finish loading and so what's the code that I'm ultimately going to run?
        I'm going to say, document dot query selectorall for any -- selcect everything that has a class of color change.
        and now i have array of things. and now i can do use a function called for each

        and what for each is going to do is it's basically going to take an array and apply a function for each element in that array.
        so i've got this array of button and i would like to do the same thing for each of the buttons inside of this array.
        And so what am i going to do each of these buttons?

        Well i'm going to run this function. the function takes this argument the button itself.
        the element of the array and what i'm going to do with that button?

        well, when the button is clicked, then go ahead and run this function.
        what is the function doing?
        well, let's get the hello heading, get its style, change the color propery of the style.
        and what value do i want to change it to? well i want to take the button and i want to get at its data dash color attribute 
        and so how do i get at the data information of an HTML element?

        In js you do this by saying button dot data set, which gets you at all the data informatin 
        about that HTML Element. and i want access the color property of that.

        so button dot data set dot color is a way of saying, all right, let's take this button, get at the data elements
        within it, and extreact the color from it.


        AUDIENCE: Why is button passed as the parameter to the function? 

BRIAN YU: All right. So the question is why is button passed as the parameter to the function? This is part of the way that for each works.
 What for each does is it takes an array and applies a function to every element in that array.
So I can actually demonstrate-- this is a good opportunity to talk a little bit about functional programming,
 which is something that JavaScript really enables, this idea of passing functions around as values of their own 
 and that you'll see in other classes. CS51 really emphasizes functional programming as an idea and is very common 
 in JavaScript programming in general. 

 forEach ex:
 
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
undefined
arr.forEach(function(elt){
    console.log(elt);
});
output:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
undefined


Arrow Function 
One new feature of ES6, one of the more recent versions of JavaScript, is a different way of defining functions. 
You can have what are called arrow functions, which is this idea that you can define a function instead of using 
the word function, you can use this arrow syntax to mean, take some input and then provide some output.

* Arrow function itself does'nt have a name. it's just an anonymous function.

() => {
    alert('Hello, World!');
}

How to define an arrow function.
const double = (x) => {   // takes an input x
    return x * 2;
}
Ex:
[1,2,3,4,5].forEach(elt => console.log(elt));
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

 And that arrow is this idea of element as the input to the function and the arrow
  is the actual body of the function. After the arrow is what the function should actually do with that individual element.

  Map() function :
  What map is going to do is it's going to apply a function to every element in the array
   and give me a new array as a result.
   This is functional programming, passing a function as arguments around in order to create interesting behavior. Yeah? 
   ex:
   [1,2,3,4,5].map(elt => elt * 2 );
output : (5) [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Filter() in array.
 you can also filter an array. So I could say, all right,
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, let me filter this array, take every element, and only return the elements that are greater than 2

ex:
[1,2,3,4,5].filter(elt => elt > 2 );
(3) [3, 4, 5]

AUDIENCE: Those filter mutate the array, or it doesn't do it? 

BRIAN YU: Does filter mutate the array? No, it's just returning to me a new array that is the result of doing that filtering.
