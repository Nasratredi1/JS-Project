        /*  Explanition.
        first, we add an event listner, wait for the Dom content to load,
        and then run this function same as before. basically just saying wait for the page 
        to finish loading.

        and then i'm saying, document dot query selector red get the red button the thing that has ID red.
        when it's clicked on click run this function.
        what function doing ?
        it's saying, all right, let me select for the thing that has ID hello, that heading.
        and then I can actually change its style.
        I can say dot style to get the style of that element
        and what property i want to change? what CSS property?
        same as anything as this property. I want to change the color and I want to change the color to red.
        
        Question about anything so for?

        IMP point that we must noted it is that. this code have some redundancy mean
        one code is repeated multiple time.
        so for betterness we make another file by the name of colors1.html which improve the 
        versoin of hello0 i hope you watch it.
