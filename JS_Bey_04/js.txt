JS: Is a client side language.

Client vs Server
Client:  the client is your computer, your web browser that your are interacting with,
you're clicking buttons on for instance

Server: The server is hosted somewhere else, code running elsewhere that you're talking to.
Your web page was making the request to some server, where that server might 
have been ruunig on your own computer. or maybe it was running on Herokue. and 
you had some server running elsewhere. and it was communicating with that.
But ultimately, you were making request to that server. and you were getting responses back.

What Js going to allow us to do it to actually run code on  the client side,
run code inside of the user's browser.
