Important Notes:

React does not let you modify the state directly.

React is a little bit smart about this things. they used for this This.setState function

this is a function that's going to take a JavaScript object and let's me change the state
of the application

Difference B/w State and props:

Props you can think of as attributes that you're going to provide into your component.
And the component never changes its own props.

Ex: hello and not want to change to hello to.

While State is something that a component has that the component might change at 
some point in the future.

 when you have application state that state is never changed directly.

Ex: count 0 and you change it to 1

After 46 minute:

ParseInt= Take the string parse it as an integer. and save it to respons or answer

Question about what we've done here so far?

Ternary condition :
boolea_expression ? value_if_true : value_if_false

if you don't provide the className you can used this quatation mark. "" 

Some Useful JS Tools:

const list1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
const list2 = [...list1,6]  // they add 6 with list1

IF you want to remove or delete something in a JavaScript used splice method

const list1 = [1,2,3,4,5];
list1.splice(3,1);  first arg pull out element start from  index 3 and 2nd arg remove one element which is 4

list is now = [1,2,3,5]

Remember map is a function that takes an array, and goes over every element in the array, and 
lets me apply some function to it.
