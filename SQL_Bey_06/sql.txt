Today, we'll continue our discussion of building web applications, in particular by talking about databases,
 which are going to be particularly important if you ever go around to trying to store information inside of a
  web application, managing users, or managing any kind of data in an application.
  look at some more advanced tools like ORMs that allow you to interact with databases a little more easily. 

  but the basic idea of what a database is, is you can think of it-- at least in our terms-- as a collection of tables. 
  And a table looks something along these lines, or you have columns that each refer to a different category of data that
   you might want to store, and then rows, one for each entry inside of a database. 

   And so you'll generally want to use a database that scales a bit better, 
   that is able to handle the load that a web application might bring. And MySQL and PostgreSQL 
   are the sorts of databases that you might use for that. And so the database we're going to be 
   using over the course of CS50 Beyond is going to be a PostgreSQL database,
   And we're using this database in particular because it'll be very easy to deploy Heroku, 
   the service we introduced a couple of days ago, to design and deploy a web application to the internet.
